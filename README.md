Sublime Text 2 Plugins
===============================================

This is just a handy place to store some plugins I wrote for ST2.


blame.py
========

blame.py is a Git blame plugin. It takes selected lines as arguments 
and outputs the data into the console.

![blame!](https://github.com/ehamiter/Sublime-Text-2-Plugins/raw/master/blame.png)


Installation
------------

Copy **blame.py** into your ST2 User packages folder *(Sublime Text 2 > 
Preferences > Browse Packages... > User)*

Usage
-----

Select text or click desired line(s), then activate. 

I've added this to my User Key Bindings, which works well (Command-Shift-B on a Mac):

    { "keys": ["super+shift+b"], "command": "blame" }

...and this in User/Context.sublime-menu, which allows context menu access:

    { "command": "blame", "caption": "Blameâ€¦" }
